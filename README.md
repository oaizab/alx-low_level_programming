# alx-low_level_programming

This repository contains a collection of C programs and projects, focusing on low-level programming concepts such as memory management, data structures, and algorithms. These programs were created as part of the ALX Software Engineering program, which provides a comprehensive curriculum for learning software development skills.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine and navigate to the root directory. You can compile each program using a C compiler such as `gcc`, and run the resulting executable file to see the program in action.

## Contents

The repository is organized into several subdirectories, each containing programs related to a particular topic or project. Some of the notable subdirectories and their contents include:

- `0x00-hello_world`: Contains basic "Hello, World!" programs and exercises to introduce C syntax and basic I/O.
- `0x01-variables_if_else_while`: Contains programs and exercises related to control flow statements such as `if`, `else`, and `while` loops.
- `0x02-functions_nested_loops`: Contains programs and exercises related to functions and nested loops.
- `0x03-debugging`: Contains programs with intentional bugs, designed to help students practice debugging skills.
- `0x04-more_functions_nested_loops`: Contains more advanced programs related to functions and nested loops, including exercises involving arrays and pointers.
- `0x05-pointers_arrays_strings`: Contains programs and exercises related to pointers, arrays, and strings.
- `0x06-pointers_arrays_strings`: Contains more advanced programs related to pointers, arrays, and strings, including exercises involving dynamic memory allocation.
